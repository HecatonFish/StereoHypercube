This program renders a small set of adjacent hypercubes to the screen

Key:			Effect
w/s				Translate camera forward/backward in R3
a/d				Translate camera left/right in R3
q/e				Translate camera up/down in R3

[Arrow Keys]	Rotate the camera
				To circle around the object in R3 it is enough to hold down the opposing translation and rotation key (d and left arrow, for example)

r/f				Rotate the object ccw/cw in xy plane
t/g				Rotate ccw/cw in xz plane
y/h				Rotate ccw/cw in xw plane
u/j				Rotate ccw/cw in yz plane
i/k				Rotate ccw/cw in yw plane
o/l				Rotate ccw/cw in zw plane

z/c				Decrease/Increase the speed of rotation of the hypercube

m				Toggle rendering monoscopically and stereoscopically
				In stereoscopic rendering the image can be viewed in 3D using the wall-eyed viewing method
				It is recommended to resize the window to be very small, as this makes wall-eyed viewing easier

space			Reset the hypercubes to their initial orientation

tab				Switch the sidedness of the rotor multiplication. Effectively changes direction of rotation

[Number Keys]	Toggle rendering of 4d hypercubes
0				is the hypercube centered at the origin
1 and 2			are offset in x
3 and 4			are offset in y
5 and 6			are offset in z
7 and 8			are offset in w
