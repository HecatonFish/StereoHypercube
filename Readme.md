#<a href="http://www.hecatonfish.com/fourcube">Stereogram Hypercube Renderer</a>

###To Install:

Download the executable and run it. Will only work on Windows Operating Systems.

###To Compile:

The project must be linked to the <a href="http://glsdk.sourceforge.net">GLSDK</a>.

###To Use:

|Key:		|	Effect
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------
|w/s		|		Translate camera forward/backward in R3
|a/d		|		Translate camera left/right in R3
|q/e		|		Translate camera up/down in R3
|		|
|[Arrow Keys]	|Rotate the camera
|		|		To circle around the object in R3 it is enough to hold down the opposing translation and rotation key (d and left arrow, for example)
|		|
|r/f		|		Rotate the object ccw/cw in xy plane
|t/g		|		Rotate ccw/cw in xz plane
|y/h		|		Rotate ccw/cw in xw plane
|u/j		|		Rotate ccw/cw in yz plane
|i/k		|		Rotate ccw/cw in yw plane
|o/l		|		Rotate ccw/cw in zw plane
|		|
|z/c		|		Decrease/Increase the speed of rotation of the hypercube
|		|
|m		|		Toggle rendering monoscopically and stereoscopically
|		|		In stereoscopic rendering the image can be viewed in 3D using the wall-eyed viewing method
|		|		It is recommended to resize the window to be very small, as this makes wall-eyed viewing easier
|space		|	Reset the hypercubes to their initial orientation
|		|
|tab		|		Change orientation of rotation
|		|
|0		|		Toggle hypercube centered at the origin
|1 and 2	|		Toggle hypercubes offset in x
|3 and 4	|		Toggle hypercubes offset in y
|5 and 6	|		Toggle hypercubes offset in z
|7 and 8	|		Toggle hypercubes offset in w
